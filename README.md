Guitar tab editor.

ASCII guitar tabs are awesome, but writing them is tedious.

This will help.

## Now what?

Press `Tab` to create a tablature stave.

#### If your cursor is on a tab stave:

Press `Tab` to add four dashes `----` to each line.

Press `|` pipe (Shift-backslash) to add a barline across the stave.

Press `Alt-Enter` to toggle Overtype mode.
_This way you can add fret numbers or other markings without wrecking your pretty alignment._

Press `Shift-Enter` to place cursors on each staff line.
_This will let you add single dashes or delete sections of tab._
